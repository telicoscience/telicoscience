👋 Hi, I’m Télico Oliveira

Backend-leaning Web Developer with practical DevOps experience
I work mainly with PHP / WordPress, Docker-based environments, and Linux servers, focusing on shipping functional systems, not demos.

My work emphasizes:

clear problem definition

pragmatic architecture

deployable solutions

maintainability over hype

🧠 What I Actually Do

I don’t try to do everything. I focus on delivering working systems.

Backend & Web

PHP applications and WordPress-based systems

Custom themes, plugin configuration, maintenance and recovery

Basic REST API integrations

Infrastructure & Delivery

Docker and Docker Compose for local and production environments

Linux VPS setup (Nginx/Apache, SSL, DNS, backups)

Manual deployments with attention to failure recovery

Engineering habits

Debugging and problem isolation

Performance troubleshooting

Clear, readable code over clever abstractions

🧰 Core Stack (focused, not inflated)

Primary

PHP · WordPress · MySQL

Docker · Docker Compose

Linux · Nginx / Apache

Git / GitHub

Secondary / Supporting

Java (algorithms and fundamentals)

HTML · CSS · JavaScript

Kubernetes (KIND — learning & local clusters)

📌 Selected Projects (representative, not exhaustive)

I prefer a few honest projects over many shallow ones.

calendario-php

A PHP-based calendar system focused on backend logic and date handling.
What it shows: business logic, data handling, simple web interface.

quiz-app

Interactive web quiz application.
What it shows: frontend/backend interaction, state handling, user flow.
Next step: persistence, scoring history, and basic tests.

exercicios_java

Collection of Java exercises and algorithms.
What it shows: logic, OOP fundamentals, disciplined practice.

damas

Checkers game implemented with clean logic separation.
What it shows: algorithmic thinking, rule modeling, structured code.

torre-de-hanoi

Classic recursive algorithm implementation.
What it shows: recursion, clarity, and explanation through code.

🔍 How I Think About Code

I avoid over-engineering when scale doesn’t justify it

I document decisions, not just outcomes

I prefer boring, reliable solutions to fragile “clever” ones

I assume systems will fail and design accordingly
